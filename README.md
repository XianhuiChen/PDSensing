# PDSensing

Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is the second most common and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder. Timely PD detection is crucial for clinical management, including medical interventions and monitoring. Smartphone-based assessments provide a promising, accessible, and cost-effective approach for early PD detection. Existing smartphone-based PD detection methods often require dozens of multi-modal tests, such as repeated walking, tapping, and voice activity tests, which can burden users and lead to reduced detection performance when limited tests are completed. This raises a key challenge in PD detection: how to achieve promising PD detection performance with fewer tests. In this study, we first propose a PD active sensing model (PDSensing) with an Actor-Critic framework that actively recommends the most informative PD tests to the user, optimizing the balance between PD detection performance and user burden. The framework consists of three main modules: (1) a PD Risk Predictor that predicts PD risks with test records, (2) an Actor module that recommends the most informative modality to users for next-round activity test to improve the Predictor's performance and (3) a Critic module that learns to estimate the rewards for each additional modality test to guide the Actor's training. Experiment results on real-world data show that our approach achieves comparable performance to baselines with only about 37.5%-50% tests, significantly reducing user burden. Moreover, we have developed a mobile app to effectively interact with users by displaying PD risk and recommending additional next-round informative activities if necessary, paving the way for actionable clinical decision-making support for early PD management.
